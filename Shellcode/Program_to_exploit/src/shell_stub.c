     *  You can use shell_array.sh to extract shellcode from an object file.
     *
     *  Note that the memory addresses in the shellcode must be aligned
     *  properly for the shellcode to work. Usually this is done by the linker,
     *  but since this is a shellcode the responsibility falls to the user.
     *
     *  So just ot clarify:
     *    - ../asm/hello.asm needs to be modified to work as a shellcode.
     *    - The code represented as it is does not work as shellcode, but you
     *      can test that a modified code works as a shellcode with this
     *      program before you complicate the matters with using it in an
     *      exploit.
     *      
     *  Breakpoint trap:
     *    - The shellcode in the example buffer uses 0xcc instruction which
     *      causes the program to drop to debugger.
     *    - If you get "Trace/breakpoint trap (core dumped)" with it, then
     *      this code works as it should.
     *
     *  Your shellcode:
     *    - Replace the array with your shellcode.
     *    - You can use ../asm/shell_array.sh to extract shellcode byte array
     *      from an executable.
