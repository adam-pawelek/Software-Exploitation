# Stack buffer overflow
<br>
### In Stack buffer overflow you can find report from this assigment
<br>
stack_1.c is a small program with a stack buffer overflow vulnerability. The program has multiple flags and the student receives points  for each flag reached.
<br>
Try to get as many flags as possible. Report the flags and how they were reached; including the inputs and any scripts used. Make sure to explain how you arrived to the results. A simple copy of the results is not enough  for a passing mark.
<br>
Refer to stack_example.c and stack_example.py for an example of a buffer overflow and an exploit. Hacking, 2nd Edition (Erickson, 2008) also demonstrates  how to exploit a stack buffer overflow.
