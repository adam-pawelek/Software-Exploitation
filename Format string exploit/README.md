The fourth and last assignment for this course is optional. Any points awarded from the this assignment are counted in addition to the required first three assignments.

**format\_1**  is a program with a format string vulnerability. The program has multiple flags and you student receives points for each flag reached.

Try to get as many flags as possible. Report the flags and how they were reached; including the inputs and any scripts used.

_Hacking (Erickson, 2008)_ chapter _0x350_ also demonstrates how to exploit format string vulnerability.
